abstract: "This study explores the Internet's role in mobilizing outside traditional social capital networks, focusing on Italy's Five Star Movement (M5S) and its use of Meetup.com for organizing grassroots events. Using Bayesian spatial modelling and surveys, it finds initial the M5S mobilization tied to high social capital areas. However, as media attention grew, the need for social capital decreased, and events spread to lower social capital areas. This led to more political discussions among disengaged voters. Social media technologies are found to facilitate political mobilization by reaching diverse demographics. This highlights Internetâ€™s potential to complement and occasionally substitute legacy mobilization networks."
excerpt: "This paper examines how digital media can activate political participation in areas traditionally excluded from social capital networks, focusing on Italy's Five Star Movement (M5S). Using a granular dataset of Meetup.com events, census data, and electoral results between 2005 and 2013, the study explores the relationship between social capital, Internet-enabled mobilization, political participation and votes."
