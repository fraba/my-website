abstract: "This paper focuses on the performance of the far-right community in the Australian Twittersphere during two information crises: the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires and the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Using a mixed method approach to analysing the performance of far-right accounts active in both crises and using an information disorder index to estimate the quality of information being shared on Twitter during the two events, we found that far-right accounts moved from the periphery of these disaster-driven conversations during the Australian bushfires to assume a more central location during the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that an increase in information disorder and overperformance of far-right accounts during COVID-19 is suggestive of an association between the two, which warrants further investigation."

In our paper out with *Information, Communication & Society*, we find that far-right accounts overperformed on Twitter during Covid-19 and associate it with more information disorder.

1. We find that far-right accounts did overperform at the onset of the pandemic if compared to selected control accounts. (As expected, journalists and politicians also overperformed during both during Covid-19 as well as during the 2019-20 Australian bushfires). We observe that the structural position of far-right accounts on Twitter changed during Covid-19: from peripheral and disconnected from the rest of the conversation to peripheral but connected.

2. We associate the overperformance of the far-right community with an increase in information disorder during the pandemic (the number of domains linked from the conversation increases while the proportion of authoritative sources decreases).
