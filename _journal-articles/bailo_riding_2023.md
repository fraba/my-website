## Abstract

This paper focuses on the performance of the far-right community in
the Australian Twittersphere during two information crises: the
2019–2020 Australian bushfires and the early months of the 2020
COVID-19 pandemic. Using a mixed method approach to analysing the
performance of far-right accounts active in both crises and using an
information disorder index to estimate the quality of information
being shared on Twitter during the two events, we found that far-right
accounts moved from the periphery of these disaster-driven
conversations during the Australian bushfires to assume a more central
location during the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that an increase in
information disorder and overperformance of far-right accounts during
COVID-19 is suggestive of an association between the two, which
warrants further investigation.
