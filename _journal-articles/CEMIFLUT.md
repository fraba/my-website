abstract: "Between 2013 and 2021, the Italian Five Star Movement implemented an advanced tool, Lex Eletti, to enhance citizens' online participation in law-making. Elected representatives had to present their draft bills on the party's platform before introducing them in Parliament, allowing ordinary party members to discuss them and suggest modifications. This paper investigates the impact of the Lex Eletti platform on participatory democracy in law-making using text analysis and sentence embeddings to compare draft bills and their parliamentary counterparts. Our analysis of a comprehensive dataset, also including statistics about MPs' and party members' online interactions and MPs' legislative activity in Parliament, reveals that the platform had minimal impact: only a few MPs engaged with it, and user attention for bills on Lex Eletti decreased over time. Interaction between platform users and MPs was also limited. Most bills reached Parliament with little to no modifications, irrespective of platform engagement levels. The Five Star Movement's attempt to foster democratic participation through this platform did not significantly affect law-making activity."

Our study on the Italian Five Star Movement's Lex Eletti platform utilised a comprehensive dataset covering 516 draft bills, statistics on MPs' and party members' online interactions, and MPs' legislative activity in Parliament from 2013 to 2020. We employed transformer models and sentence embeddings to compare the draft bills posted on Lex Eletti with their parliamentary counterparts. This method allowed us to measure the extent of changes resulting from the online participatory process and assess the engagement levels between MPs and ordinary party members.

The results revealed that Lex Eletti had minimal impact on the legislative process. Only a few MPs consistently used the platform, and user engagement significantly declined over time. Interaction between MPs and platform users was limited, with most bills reaching Parliament with little to no modifications despite the participatory process. The findings indicate that the Five Star Movement's attempt to enhance democratic participation through Lex Eletti did not significantly affect the legislative activity, highlighting the challenges of integrating digital platforms into traditional law-making processes.
