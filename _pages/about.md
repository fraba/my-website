I am interested in the use of digital and social media in politics. I obtained my PhD at the University of Sydney in 2017 with research on online political participation using computational methods for text and network analysis. Before academia, I have worked in development assistance for the Australian government, non-governmental organisations and the UN. I lived in Afghanistan, Guatemala, Mauritius and Ecuador.

I have published on the role played by internet technologies on political participation in *Social Media + Society*, *Information, Communication & Society*, *Political Studies* and *Policy Studies* and on Italian politics in *European Political Science*. I have published a book with Palgrave on the online communities during the emergence of M5S.
