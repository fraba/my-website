This chapter presents a comparative analysis of contemporary populism
in Australia and Italy, reflecting on the similarities and differences
of both. In Italy, populist parties have been playing a mainstream
role since 1992. The country’s four populist parties have been in
power, almost continuously, since 2010. They express different
populist features, but still their politics is fundamentally rooted in
the widespread sense of distrust towards state and governmental
institutions. In Australia, the continued decline in democratic
satisfaction and trust in political leaders and institutions has
correlated with a rise of independents and minor parties, as well as
leadership instability within the major political parties. We
investigate the interaction between different forces—the media system,
the party and electoral system, and long-term decline in political
trust—to explain why the expression of populism in Australia has been
radically different from that of Italy.
