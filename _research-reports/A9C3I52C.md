abstract: ''
excerpt: 'In light of the enormous social, economic, political, cultural and ethical challenges presented by rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI), and particularly generative artificial intelligence, the opportunity to participate in a policy deliberation process that aims to address questions of the social good at an early stage, and to design suitable regulations to meet such challenges, is very much welcomed.'
