In a [report](http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2009-04-21/increase-number-people-affected-climate-disasters) published today, [Oxfam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam) predicts that by 2015 the average number of people affected by climate-related disasters every year will increase by **54%**. The [projection](http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/policy/climate_change/downloads/forecasting_disasters_2015.pdf) is based on a forecasting model that uses data, collected by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, going back to 1900. Oxfam's researchers have noticed that climate-related disasters have been increasing in frequency and severity during the last years so they expect that by 2015 **375 million** people (or **132 million** more than in 2007) will be affected. Jeremy Hobbs, Oxfam International’s Executive Director, said that

> The humanitarian system works as if it’s a global card game dealing out aid randomly, not based on people’s needs. The response is often fickle – too little, too late and not good enough. The world barely copes with the current level of disasters. A big increase in the numbers of people affected will overwhelm it unless there is fundamental reform of the system that puts those in need at its centre.

And this supposedly happens while NGOs are downsizing their budgets because of the crisis. According to [Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2009/04/21/face-a-la-crise-les-ong-rationalisent-leurs-projets_1183350_3244.html#xtor=RSS-3244), many organizations have seen a significant decrease in private donation during 2009. More deadly predictions on the way?
