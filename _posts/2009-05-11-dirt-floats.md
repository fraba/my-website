The Kosovo Liberation Army (Albanian acronym UÇK) supposedly run, during the conflict of 1999, torture camps in northern Albania. According to an investigation conducted by Altin Raxhimi, Michael Montgomery and Vladimir Karaj and published ([here](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/investigations/18064/)) by the [Balkan Investigative Journalism Network](http://www.birn.eu.com/) at least 18 people were killed in one of those, a factory compound in Kukës, Albania. Eyewitnesses say prisoner were mainly alleged Kosovo Albanian collaborationist. But as well Serbs and Roma were held in the camp.  And women.

> Kosovo’s Prime Minister, [Hashim Thaçi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashim_Tha%C3%A7i), who was then the political director of the KLA, and [Agim Çeku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agim_Ceku), former Prime Minister and former chief of the KLA headquarters, told the BBC they were not aware of any KLA prisons where captives were abused or where civilians were held.

> The same sources that witnessed the base in Kukës, told us that the interrogators in Kukës were KLA officers who had been involved in the capture of suspected collaborators. Both our sources concerning the base, identified several KLA officers involved in the abuses at Kukës. One of them is currently in a top position in the judicial system in Kosovo.

After ten years, the history of the ex-Yugoslavia conflicts (so far mainly written by journalists) is still incomplete. Because the people who fought those wars are now ruling that very same land (nationalism is still an effective language to speak). And because the Balkans are the very same mirror and unconscious of Europe ([Rada Iveković](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rada_Ivekovic), 1999). The 1990s wars tell Europe where its own states are coming from: murders and  deportations. And Dorian does not like portraits.
