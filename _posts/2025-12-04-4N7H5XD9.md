excerpt: "We develop a scalable framework for measuring information disorder without adjudicating truth claims and find that Facebook's algorithms systematically amplified election skepticism over consensus during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, with posts questioning election fairness achieving significantly greater viral reach regardless of partisan affiliation."

Information disorder—characterized by contradictory claims within
digital information environments—undermines democratic deliberation in
ways that traditional misinformation research cannot adequately
capture. We develop a scalable framework for measuring disorder based
on semantic relationships between information units (infons), without
requiring truth adjudication. Applying large language models to
classify relationships among 969,207 Facebook posts from 38,149
accounts during the 2020 U.S. presidential election period (October
26–December 1, 2020), we construct temporal networks of agreement and
disagreement.

*Figure 1. Temporal dynamics of disagreement across general and partisan samples.*

Our findings reveal three key patterns. First, internal disagreement
increased sharply following Election Day, with Republican-affiliated
accounts exhibiting substantially higher disorder than Democrat
accounts (see Figure 1). Second, stance toward election legitimacy
diverged markedly along partisan lines: Democrat accounts maintained
consistent agreement that the election was conducted fairly, while
Republican accounts exhibited sustained disagreement. Third, and most
critically, posts expressing skepticism toward election fairness
achieved significantly greater viral reach than those affirming it
across all partisan contexts, suggesting that platform dynamics
systematically amplified disorder-generating content (see Figure 2).

These findings demonstrate the utility of network-based measures for
diagnosing information ecosystem health and reveal how algorithmic
amplification may exacerbate democratic information crises. Our
framework provides policymakers and platform designers with actionable
metrics for assessing information environment quality without requiring contested judgments about truth.
