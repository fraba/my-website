The Inter-American Development Bank [publishes](http://www.iadb.org/news/detail.cfm?language=English&id=5160) today on its web-site previsions for remittance flows in 2009 to Latin America: they will go down for the first time since 2000. And different countries are experiencing different situation. The Andean region is effected worse by the decline of the euro whereas the Mesoamerica region sees a strong dollar partially counterbalance the decrease in money flow.

According to the [Banco de Guatemala](http://www.banguat.gob.gt/inc/ver.asp?id=/estaeco/remesas/remfam2009.htm&e=66305), in the first two month of 2009 remittances to the country have diminished by **9.59%** comparing with same period of 2008.
