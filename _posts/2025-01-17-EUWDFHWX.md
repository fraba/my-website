Wikibase, a free knowledge graph software developed by the Wikimedia Foundation, powers Wikidata by centralising and structuring information into a graph database for consistency and machine readability. Our upcoming book Collaborative Use of Wikibase for Interdisciplinary Mixed-Methods Research outlines how research teams can utilise Wikibase to manage, integrate, and analyse complex data collaboratively. By facilitating data linking, ontology design, and collaborative editing, Wikibase becomes an essential tool for interdisciplinary research projects, bridging qualitative and quantitative methods seamlessly.
