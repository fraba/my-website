The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has published the [Annual Report 2008](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.31.Add.1.pdf) on Guatemala. And hardly could have been worse. Last year murder rate was of 48 homicides per 100.000 inhabitants, almost a world record for a country at peace. Extra-judicial executions were reported. The number of people who died in custody increased. Irregular militas were responsible for episodes of the so-called "social cleaning" where victims were tortured and finally executed. Over the year 722 women where killed. 56 people were lynched. According to the High Commissioner the Government should

> refine the legislative framework for the protection of human rights (...); improve criminal investigations carried out by the National Civilian Police, on the basis of an appropriate organizational structure, trained personnel, an adequate territorial deployment, and the availability of technical and scientific resources (...); strengthen areas of civil jurisdiction, in order to prevent civil conflicts becoming criminal matters (...); adopt special measures to combat discrimination in all areas, and in particular to overcome the conditions of inequality which impede indigenous peoples’ access to economic, social andcultural rights (...); strengthen measures to increase the understanding and application of the new Law on Femicide and Other Forms of Violence against Women (...); promote a comprehensive tax reform, enabling an expansion of fiscal resources and an increase in tax collection.
