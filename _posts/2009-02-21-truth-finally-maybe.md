Guatemalan newspaper _La Hora_ [affirms](http://www.lahora.com.gt/notas.php?key=44565&fch=2009-02-19) that, for the first time, the  government will hand to the ministerio público (attorney general) the military archives regarding cases of genocide occurred during the civil war (1960-1996). The decision was taken after the constitutional court notification to president Álvaro Colom.  In particular, the military files concern the campaign plans named "Victoria 82", "Firmeza 83" and the operational plans named "Ixil" (1982) and "Sofía" (July 15, 1982).

So far, it is not known when this will happen. But the Secretary of peace, Orlando Blanco, confirmed that this will happened.

The archives will effect the trial for violation of human rights and genocide, began in 2000, against the former presidents of Guatemala Lucas García and Ríos Montt.

According to the [Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico](http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/mds/spanish/toc.html), during the [Guatemala civil war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala_Civil_War) (conflicto armado interno) **200,000** people had been killed . Most of them (**93%**) were victims of state security forces and most of them (**83%**) were Maya. Between **500,000** and **1.5 million** people were displaced.
