What if we are becoming the very same Artificial Intelligence that we are trying to design? The doubt has has been raised by [Nicholas Carr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Carr) in an article published one year ago on [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google) and now published on [Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2009/06/05/est-ce-que-google-nous-rend-idiot_1203030_651865.html#xtor=RSS-651865). The theory is intriguing and the discourse goes, in the words of developmental psychologist [Maryanne Wolf](http://ase.tufts.edu/faculty-guide/fac/mwolf.childdev.htm), more or less in this direction:

> We are not only _what_ we read, We are _how_ we read.

So, learning directly from the voice of Socrates is not the same as learning from the Internet. The way we approach new ideas and knowledge influences how we assimilate them and how we develop our thinking. The risk is that our mind might find so attractive the effectivness of the Google's algorithm to try to replicate it forgetting all the ambiguity that has made us what we are. What we are so far.

**Update**: Have a look at [this article](http://www.lemonde.fr/web/imprimer_element/0,40-0@2-651865,50-1206368,0.html) on _Le Monde_ about the influence of the new information technologies on culture.
