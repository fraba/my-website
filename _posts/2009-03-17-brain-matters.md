Saying that education strengths economic growth sounds good old common sense. But proving and measuring this relation is not immediate and therefore interesting. A [reasearch](http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/16110377.html), published last year, does it. Eric Hanushek, Dean T. Jamison, Eliot A. Jamison and Ludger Woessmann estimate that

> each additional year of average schooling in a country increased the average 40-year growth rate in GDP by about **0.37 percentage points**. That may not seem like much, but consider the fact that since World War II, the world economic growth rate has been around **2 to 3 percent of GDP** annually. Lifting it by 0.37 percentage points is a boost to annual growth rates of more than **10 percent** of what would otherwise have occurred, a significant amount.

Nonetheless, the research suggests that what really matters for economic growth is the quality of education. In other words it is not enough to send children to school: you have to teach them something. Using test-score performances around the world to measure the cognitive skills of students appears

> that countries with higher test scores experienced far higher growth rates. If one country’s test-score performance was 0.5 standard deviations higher than another country during the 1960s (...) the first country’s growth rate was, on average, **one full percentage point higher** annually over the following 40-year period than the second country’s growth rate. Further, once the impact of higher levels of cognitive skills are taken into account, the significance for economic growth of school attainment, i.e., additional years of schooling, dwindles to nothing. A country benefits from asking its students to remain in school for a longer period of time only if the students are learning something as a consequence.

These results are extremely important especially for the countries of the [Bottom Billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bottom_Billion). What they are saying is that it is better to invest on the quality of the education (where rate of return is much higher) rather than spending to keep students in schools longer.
