According to [Banco de Guatemala](http://www.banguat.gob.gt/inc/ver.asp?id=/estaeco/remesas/remfam2009.htm&e=66305), for the first time since 1999, in January 2009 remittances from abroad decreased by **7.75%** compared to the same month in 2008. In Guatemala remittance  flows represent **11.89%** of GDP. According to the [World Bank](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAML/Resources/US-Guatamala.pdf) remittances can represent **more than 50%** of rurally-based family income and for the [International Organization for Migration](http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/pbnAM/cache/offonce?entryId=19554) **30.4%** of the population receives money from abroad.

Causes? Probably economic crisis and deportation of  illegal immigrants from the US.

Something is certain: remittances are a strong factor in reducing poverty in Guatemala. If flows continue to decrease is more than probable that poverty will rise in a country where, according to [the government](http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/576597.html), **45,6%** of children are already underweight.
