Increase in food prices has pushed back into poverty at least **100 million** people in 2008 and, according to the United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition ([here](http://www.unscn.org/Publications/SCNNews/scnnews37.pdf), p. 60),

> erase at least four years of progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1 target for the reduction of poverty. The household level consequences of this crisis are most acutely felt in LIFDCs \[[Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries](http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/lifdc.asp)\] where a **50%** rise in staple food prices causes a **21%** increase in total food expenditure, increasing these from **50** to **60%** of income. In a high income country this rise in prices causes a 6% rise in retail food expenditure with income expenditure on food rising from 10 to 11%. FAO estimates that food price rises have resulted in at least **50 million** more people becoming hungry in 2008, going back to the 1970 figures.

According to the World Bank ([here](http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13881048&fsrc=rss)) this means that between **200,000** and **400,000** more children will died every year for malnutrition until 2015.
