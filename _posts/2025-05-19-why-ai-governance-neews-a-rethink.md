As AI systems become more powerful and accessible, we’re witnessing a surge in *unintended, fringe uses* that current regulatory frameworks can’t keep up with. In our new article with Milly Stilinovic and Jonathon Hutchinson in [*New Media & Society*](https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448251338511) and its companion piece in [*The Conversation*](https://theconversation.com/ai-is-moving-fast-climate-policy-provides-valuable-lessons-for-how-to-keep-it-in-check-255624), we introduce a new concept: the **Undersphere**.

## What is the Undersphere?

We define the **Undersphere** as a networked space of creative experimentation that exists outside formal markets and institutions — places like GitHub, Reddit (e.g., r/StableDiffusion), and Hugging Face. Here, AI isn’t just consumed; it’s *remixed*, *repurposed*, and *pushed in unexpected directions*. These communities aren’t necessarily political, but their outcomes often are.

A notorious example is the rapid rise of **deepfake pornography**, which emerged not from corporate labs, but from creative subcultures operating in these loosely regulated, experimental spaces. Today, more than 98% of all deepfake videos online fall into this category.

## What’s the Risk?

The risks posed by the Undersphere aren’t just technical — they’re **democratic**. Generative AI used in these contexts challenges core principles like consent, privacy, and truth. Yet existing regulatory responses (like the EU AI Act) are structured around *intended use*, with little room to manage the messier, more creative misuse of these tools.

We argue that **risk is not static or predictable**. Generative AI’s diffusion across social media and developer communities creates **complex, cascading, and systemic risks** — exactly the kind of challenges traditional frameworks struggle to contain.


## Climate Governance as a Model for AI

To better respond to these challenges, we propose that AI governance take inspiration from **climate governance** — which has evolved to deal with uncertain, distributed, and long-term risks. That means:

- Shifting from rigid regulation to **adaptive governance**
- Accepting **uncertainty and incomplete knowledge** as a feature, not a bug
- Focusing on **networks of risk**, not isolated use cases
- Engaging **diverse voices** to anticipate unintended harms

This approach, we argue, is more likely to protect the public and the democratic fabric of our societies than reactive bans or usage-based categorisations.

## From LOAB to Legislation

One striking case we analyse is the viral AI creation **LOAB** — a haunting, unintended output of text-to-image models, discovered and shared through Reddit. The community around LOAB exemplifies the Undersphere: highly creative, technically proficient, yet operating entirely outside institutional oversight.

When these practices intersect with social platforms and public discourse, the results can be *transformative or catastrophic* — and governance must prepare for both.
