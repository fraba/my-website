Human Rights Watch has just [published](http://www.hrw.org/node/81430) a detailed report on _Womenâ€™s Struggles to Obtain Health Care in United States Immigration Detention_. Immigration detention facilities are black holes all around the world. For one thing it is difficult to understand or explain why a state should imprison somebody who has committed no crime at all. At least for those who tend to consider existing as a right and not as a crime. HRW writes that in the United States

> the number of individuals held in administrative detention while their immigration cases are determined has skyrocketed in recent years. The detained population on any given day is now over **29,000** nationwide, up almost **50 percent** from 2005.

And according to the report the overshadowing sanitary problems for women in this condition are

> delays and denials of testing and treatment, obstacles to obtaining medical care, distortions in the doctor-patient relationship, detrimental and unnecessary use of restraints and strip searches, discontinuity of care, lack of effective remedies.
