title: "Presentation @ WSU: Breaking out of Legacy Mobilization Networks"
permalink: "/JUQ7GRTD/"
excerpt: "This study explores the Internet's role in mobilizing outside traditional social capital networks, focusing on Italy's Five Star Movement (M5S) and its use of Meetup.com for organizing grassroots events. Using Bayesian spatial modelling and surveys, it finds initial the M5S mobilization tied to high social capital areas. However, as media attention grew, the need for social capital decreased, and events spread to lower social capital areas. This led to more political discussions among disengaged voters. Social media technologies are found to facilitate political mobilization by reaching diverse demographics. This highlights Internet’s potential to complement and occasionally substitute legacy mobilization networks."

This study explores the Internet's role in mobilizing outside traditional social capital networks, focusing on Italy's Five Star Movement (M5S) and its use of Meetup.com for organizing grassroots events. Using Bayesian spatial modelling and surveys, it finds initial the M5S mobilization tied to high social capital areas. However, as media attention grew, the need for social capital decreased, and events spread to lower social capital areas. This led to more political discussions among disengaged voters. Social media technologies are found to facilitate political mobilization by reaching diverse demographics. This highlights Internet’s potential to complement and occasionally substitute legacy mobilization networks.
