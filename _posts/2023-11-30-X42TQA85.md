Studies conducted before the massification of the ICTs have estimated
that about 80% of those joining a political movement had pre-existing
connections with people already in the movement (Diani and Lodi,
1989). The role of social capital in facilitating mobilisation is well
supported theoretically and empirically (Seyd and Whiteley 2004;
Ostrom and Ahn 2007). Internet technologies should theoretically
reduce the importance of existing face-to-face networks and social
capital for political mobilisation (Lybeck, Koiranen & Koivula 2023):
Internet users can more easily activate connections to a political
movement, even in the absence of any existing direct, personal
connection. We investigate whether this is the case using responses to
an online survey (n = 698) administered to participants at
face-to-face meetings organised to support Italy's M5S. The case study
is particularly pertinent to assess our research question as the
selected party is one of Europe's main digital native political
organisations (Gerbaudo 2018). Not surprisingly, preliminary results
indicate that 'pre- existing connections' are, on average, still
critical. Taking advantage of the uneven distribution of social
capital between northern and southern regions and using a number of
control questions about political interest and knowledge, political
distrust and individual participatory experiences, we further
investigate frequency and characteristics of instances where ICTs
appeared to have successfully substituted social capital in recruiting
participants.
