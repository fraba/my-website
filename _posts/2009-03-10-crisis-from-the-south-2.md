And it appears that the  problem is not just limited to remittances. According to [The Institute of International Finance](http://www.iif.com/), private financial flows from rich countries to poor ones will decrease by **63%** this year: from US$ **456,8 billions** in 2008 down to **165,4 billions** in 2009. In 2007 these flows amounted to US$ **928,6 billion**.Talking about Latin America, inflows will be down  **51%** from 2008 level and **76%** considering 2007 level.

Money are basically heading home.
