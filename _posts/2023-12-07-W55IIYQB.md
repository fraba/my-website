## Research Questions
1. **Internet and Participatory Gap**: Does the Internet's widespread use from 2005 to 2020 reduce the participatory gap in politics? 
   - *Finding*: No significant reduction; gender and education remain key participation predictors.
2. **Personal Networks in M5S Recruitment**: How does the importance of personal networks evolve with M5S's popularity?
   - *Finding*: Personal networks' role remains stable; importance of social capital, especially political social capital, declines.
3. **Internet for Disadvantaged Groups**: Are Internet affordances more critical for politically disadvantaged groups in M5S recruitment and engagement?
   - *Finding*: Internet is more important for low-education and female participants.

## Conclusions
- Internet affordances have a marginal leveling effect in political participation.
- This effect might close the participatory gap and escape the social capital trap, contingent on media validation and access through personal networks.
